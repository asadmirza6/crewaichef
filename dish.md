**Yields:** 4 servings
**Prep time:** 30 minutes
**Marinating time:** At least 4 hours, preferably overnight
**Cook time:** 20-25 minutes


**Ingredients:**

**For the Chicken Marinade:**

* 1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes
* 1 cup plain yogurt (full-fat recommended)
* 1/4 cup lemon juice (freshly squeezed)
* 2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste
* 1 tbsp saffron threads, steeped in 1/4 cup hot water for 15 minutes
* 1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro
* 1/4 cup finely chopped mint
* 1/4 cup shelled pistachios, roughly chopped
* 2 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)
* 1/2 tsp cumin powder
* 1/2 tsp coriander powder
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* Salt to taste


**For the Pomegranate Glaze:**

* 1/2 cup pomegranate juice
* 2 tbsp honey
* 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* 1 tsp grated ginger


**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Saffron Infusion:** Steep saffron threads in hot water for at least 15 minutes to release their vibrant color and flavor.
2. **Marinate the Chicken:** In a large bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, saffron infusion (including the threads), cilantro, mint, pistachios, garam masala, turmeric, paprika, chili powder, cumin, coriander, black pepper, and salt. Add the chicken and mix well, ensuring all pieces are coated evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.
3. **Preheat & Cook:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) or prepare your grill.  You can also cook these in a skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally.
4. **Bake/Grill/Pan-fry:** Thread the marinated chicken onto skewers (metal or soaked wooden) or arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until cooked through and slightly charred.  If grilling, cook for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until cooked through. If pan-frying, cook for about 8-10 minutes, turning frequently.
5. **Make the Glaze:** While the chicken is cooking, combine pomegranate juice, honey, balsamic vinegar, and grated ginger in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until slightly thickened.
6. **Glaze & Serve:** Brush the cooked chicken tikka with the pomegranate glaze. Serve immediately with rice, naan bread, raita (yogurt dip), and a side salad.


**Tips & Variations:**

* For extra flavor, add a pinch of cardamom powder to the marinade.
* If you don't have pistachios, you can substitute with almonds or cashews.
* For a spicier tikka, increase the amount of chili powder.
* You can also use boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs.  Keep in mind they will cook faster.
